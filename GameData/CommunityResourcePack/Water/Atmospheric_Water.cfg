// Assume atmospheric compositions are for upper atmosphere
// Water confined to troposphere on most planets, not included in resource model

// But based on the temperature, pressure, and ocean fraction, I'm pretty sure Eve is a steam world
// Vapor pressure at surface is 4.66 atm
// Only known steam world IRL is Titan: assume ~0.5× vapor pressure in lower atmosphere, and 
//	~ 0.3× that in upper atmosphere, like there
